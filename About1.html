       <h2>Geography And Climate</h2>Baglung Bazar is situated on a plateau overlooking the Kali Gandaki gorge directly south of the Dhaulagiri Himalayan range. Steep cliffs rising from the valley flank the plateau on three sides. City limits are roughly determined by the Theule Khola to the south, Kali Gandaki river to the east and Dhodeni Khola to the north.
       Baglung enjoys warm summers and mild winters. Annual average temperatures range from a maximum of 26.6 °C (79.9 °F) and a minimum of 19.1 °C (66.4 °F). Highs above 35 °C (95 °F) and lows below 0 °C (32 °F) are rare.<p> The average annual rainfall recorded is 1,060.9 mm (41.77 in) in 1982.[1] Rainfall is heavily affected by the monsoon and most of it occurs during the months of June through September. Rest of the year is mostly dry and sunny. Snowfall is extremely rare in the city core, however, higher elevations within the city limits see occasional snow during the winter months. Due to large topographic variation climate ranging from hot subtropical to temperate montane climate can be experienced within the city limit</p>
