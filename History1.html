    	Pilgrims from India and rest of Nepal traveling to Muktinath and traders seeking to barter grains from the south with salt from Tibet frequented a trade route along the banks of Kaligandaki river since ancient times. However, owing to its location high above the banks of Kaligandaki river and the trade route few actually ventured into the area that is Baglung Bazar today. The area also lacked reliable source of water for drinking and irrigation making it poorly suited for settlement. A lack of evidence of structures and settlements predating 16th century in the area and a lack of mention in historical records predating 16th century support this notion. First confirmed history of settlement in Baglung is found during the reign of King Pratapi Narayan of Parbat (later Galkot) Kingdom in the early 16th century.

In year 1534 AD King Pratapi Narayan of Parbat married daughter of king Manimukunda Sen of Palpa. As the wedding procession reached Baglung, following a dream, the king decided to establish goddess Kalika brought from Palpa at the site. Holder of the goddesses sword Chakra Panwar was given the title of Khadka and asked to stay back as caretaker of the goddess. He was also bestowed with the land that forms Baglung Bazar today. The Magar carriers of the idol were settled in Lung Gau area of Baglung. A temple was built and an annual fair was started during the Chaitre Dashain festival. Descendants of Chakra Panwar Khadka built irrigation channels, pastures, watering holes, fruit gardens and established first establishments in Baglung. Baglung also emerged as an outpost for revenue collection and taxation as the Khadka family also served as local revenue collection officers and militia commanders.

Three hundred years later, following annexation of the Parbat kingdom by Gorkha, Newar traders from Bhaktapur arrived in Baglung and established permanent trading houses and market. During this era Baglung was also proclaimed as a "choti gauda" or district headquarters and official judicial, military, mint and taxation offices were established. Baglung continued to act as administrative headquarters during the Rana regime. After establishment of the current district and zonal system Baglung retained its status as headquarters serving the area.
